# Internships

__TNG Technology Consulting__ \hfill _Munich, Germany (3 months in 2018)_

__I worked full stack on a Python Flask web application which extracted important data from legal documents using simple NLP techniques. I developed all of the front-end and a big part of cleaning uploaded documents. Additionally, created continuous testing pipelines with Jenkins, tox and pytest. Became familiar with JavaScript and Pandas. Acquired experience working in agile teams, writing good tests, developing REST APIs and presenting and talking to clients.__ I was hired for this internship before I had even started university.
