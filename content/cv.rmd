# Internships

I worked full stack on a Python Flask web application for analyzing legal documents. During this I became familiar with JavaScript, Pandas, Flask and Jenkins. I also acquired experience working in agile teams, writing good and meaningful tests, developing REST APIs and presenting projects to clients. I was hired for this internship before I had even started university.
