# The interactive rebase

The interactive rebase is one of the most powerful tools in git. The idea of the rebase is to change the base of a branch to something different, replaying unique commits on top of the base. In a way this is a cherry-pick that picks the whole branch instead of a single commit. The interactive rebase allows the user to rebase, but also edit the commits before rebasing.

```
git rebase -i <new_base_branch>
```

You can change commit messages, drop and squash commits.


# Heads and references

There are several useful references used by git which include the name `HEAD`. All of them contain a reference to a specific commit hash and could be used as shortcuts.

## The `HEAD`

`HEAD` references the latest commit on the current branch. Sometimes the head can be in detached state - the head is not pointing to the most recent commit.

## ORIG_HEAD

`ORIG_HEAD` is a reference to the `HEAD` before a dangerous operation. For example, before a merge, the `ORIG_HEAD` is usually set to `HEAD` so the user can revert if something goes wrong during the merge.

## git reflog

Running `git reflog` in a git repo returns something like this:

```
00h3h99 HEAD@{0}: commit: Last commit
lbl1e19 HEAD@{1}: commit: Previous commit
f2ka3s3 HEAD@{2}: commit: Second commit
kf46be6 HEAD@{3}: commit: First commit
```

This gives us a hint - we can use `HEAD@{-number-}` to quickly navigate between commits, where `-number-` is the amount off commits back you want to go. However there are several ways of doing this: `HEAD^` or `HEAD~` will give the parent commit of the head and `HEAD^2` or `HEAD~2` or `HEAD^^` or `HEAD~~` will give the second parent of the commit.
